                <h3>About me</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="about-info-body">
                <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer by heart but have started to love the idea of data and its uses on
                    making decisions. I have
                    deep interest in renewables and how it is going to be the next step to evolution of mankind. I
                    have performed various
                    projects during my undergrad 2 of which are on renewable energy. One is a Footstep Power
                    Generation, and the other is
                    Twisted Tube Solar Water Heater. Currently, I am fixated on data right from extraction to data
                    cleaning, preprocessing
                    it and generating insights using statistics and data visualization for better decision making.
                </p>
                <p>I am a Cristiano Ronaldo fan because of his work ethic and fitness and have been following him
                    since his days in Manchester
                    United and how he has risen to be the best player in the world. His fitness inspired me to
                    regularly go to the gym and I
                    believe strength training is an important routine to follow to keep oneself fit and healthy.
                    Sports has taught me the
                    meaning of teamwork, consistency, and practice. I have been a swimmer and basketball player
                    during my school days. I
                    have also taken part in Model United Nations which has taught me how to be outspoken, take a
                    stand, research and I am
                    thankful of such opportunities at a young age in helping me groom into a confident individual.
